	<p>Artificial intelligence art is any artwork, particularly images and musical compositions, created through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) programs, such as text-to-image models and musical generators. It is sometimes confused with digital art.
		While both AI art and digital art involve the use of technology,
		AI art is characterize by its use of generative algorithms and deep learning techniques that can autonomously produce art without direct input from human artists.</p>
