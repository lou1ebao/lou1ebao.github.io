<p>Generative artificial intelligence or generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of generating text,
  images, or other media in response to prompts. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data,
  and then generate new data that has similar characteristics.

Notable generative AI systems include ChatGPT (and its variant Bing Chat), 
  a chatbot built by OpenAI using their GPT-3 and GPT-4 foundational large language models, and Bard, 
  a chatbot built by Google using their LaMDA foundation model. Other generative 
  AI models include artificial intelligence art systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.

Generative AI has potential applications across a wide range of industries, 
  including art, writing, software development, healthcare, finance, gaming, marketing, and fashion. 
  Investment in generative AI surged during the early 2020s, with large companies such as Microsoft, Google, 
  and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms developing generative AI models. However, there are also concerns 
  about the potential misuse of generative AI, 
  such as in creating fake news or deepfakes, which can be used to deceive or manipulate people.</p>
